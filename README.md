# trakr

> Simple cli time tracking utility

Post-processor for output of the `trackie` cli utility.
Will offer filtering and grouping commands for the JSON output
of `trackie`.

It is planned to implement all features of `trackie`, so that `trakr`
can be used as a standalone tool.


## TODOs

- [ ] cli commands setup
- [ ] JSON object lenses (from scratch)
- [ ] group projects based on a tag (format: `tag:name-of-task`)
